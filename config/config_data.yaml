# dataset config

# dataset to download
# THINGS TO NOTE: for this version of the code, you need to put sentinel2 first if you want to download it along with other datasets. This is because s2 is the base dataset and we use it to get the tile information.
# Incase you have already downloaded s2, then you can put any dataset first, and it downloads the other datasets. The name of the dataset should be the same name as the function call. Here are the names of the functions:
# sentinel2, sentinel1, srtm, era5
# datasets: ["sentinel2", "sentinel1", "aster", "era5", "dynamic_world", "canopy_height_eth", "esa_worldcover"] 
datasets: ["era5"]


# config for the data
# make sure there is no space in the 'name' field
